# DataCup
Challenge To better foster this dialogue around how data is used in businesses, Desjardins will be releasing an anonymized dataset and will encourage the community to explore it and extract insights from it. Participants will have 2 weeks to train the best predictive model to tackle a real-life scenario, just as data engineers, data scientists, developers and business analysts at Desjardins would have. The top 5 teams on the Data Cup scoring platform will have an additional 7 days to prepare a presentation for a jury consisting of industry experts from Desjardins and its partners.  Data Cup is open to data aficionados from all backgrounds and demographics, whether they be students or industry professionals, subject matter experts or d3.js artists and to Desjardins employees as well (with some minor stipulations, see guidelines). We encourage you to bring your creative lightbulb moments, brainiest friends and your slickest ML tricks, you’re going to need it. All to show off your geek cred and lift the trophy at Desjardins’ first ever Data Cup!
